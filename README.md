# Image-Recognition
The goal of this project was to develop and evaluate supervised learning models for accurately predicting fashion item categories from images. This involved training various models on a dedicated training set and evaluating their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and AUC. Detailed analysis of model performance allowed us to identify the best-performing model after employing hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation. In a subsequent phase, the chosen model was applied to personal fashion items, captured in a square format, resized to 28x28 pixels, and converted to grayscale. A comprehensive visualization was created to display all images together, and the model was used to predict item categories. The project's success was gauged by assessing the accuracy of these predictions, highlighting the chosen model's ability to accurately categorize personal fashion items based on the provided images.
